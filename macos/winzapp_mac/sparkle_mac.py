"""Updates through Sparkle 2, gated by the official repository's tags.

A release build whose Info.plist names a Sparkle feed and key
(sparkle_policy.configured(), written by build_app.py from
WINZAPP_SPARKLE_PUBLIC_KEY) updates through Sparkle's standard windows, which
VoiceOver reads well; the "Check for updates" menu item and the automatic
check WinZapp starts after launch go to Sparkle instead of UpdateChecker.
Without those keys, or if Sparkle.framework cannot be loaded or started,
nothing here runs and updater_mac goes on exactly as before.

What WinZapp checks (sparkle_policy explains why only this): the release is
an existing tag of the official repository pointing at the commit its
provenance declares, newer than the running tag
(updater_mac.release_provenance()), and the appcast item stands for exactly
that tag's full zip. Sparkle downloads, verifies (signed appcast, EdDSA, code
signing) and installs. Updates are downloaded in the background and installed
when WinZapp quits (sparkle_policy.plist_keys() explains the keys). With
Sparkle 2.10.0's public API only:

1. Before Sparkle shows or downloads a release: updater:shouldProceedWithUpdate:...
   (SPUUpdaterDelegate.h:252), Sparkle's one veto before anything is shown
   or downloaded (SPUBasicUpdateDriver.m:150-158), for the scheduled
   background download as for a check the user starts. It is synchronous on
   the main thread and the answer needs the network, so the first answer is a
   silent abort (SUInstallationCanceledError, SPUUIBasedUpdateDriver.m:
   482-483), the question runs on a thread, and its end starts the same kind
   of check again, which the stored verdict (at most VERDICT_TTL old) answers.
2. A scheduled check, with "check for updates automatically" on, downloads
   the release that passed 1 without a window (SPUAutomaticUpdateDriver.m:
   87-97) and leaves Sparkle's installer waiting for the app to end
   (:104-128); updater:willInstallUpdateOnQuit:immediateInstallationBlock:
   (SPUUpdaterDelegate.h:440) records it (update_accounts.ARMED_FILE) and
   answers NO, so Sparkle ends that cycle and its next check shows the update
   as downloaded, with "Install and Relaunch" (SPUUpdater.m:903-906,
   SPUUIBasedUpdateDriver.m:236-237). Quitting installs it. The installer
   watches only the first running process of the app
   (InstallerProgressAppController.m:292-308) and installs as soon as that
   one ends (AppInstaller.m:403-410), and every account is a process of the
   same app: so while an update is armed, ending any account ends them all
   (the real_exit wrapper below), and the accounts the user did not close are
   opened again once the installer is done (update_accounts.RELAUNCH_SCRIPT).
   No second provenance check is possible there: the install happens after
   the app is gone. Check 1 is its gate.
3. When the user chooses Install in Sparkle's window (WinZapp's subclass of
   Sparkle's standard user driver holds that reply,
   SPUUIBasedUpdateDriver.m:244-275): the appcast item is checked again
   (an update Sparkle resumes skipped step 1, SPUBasicUpdateDriver.m:150), the
   other accounts quit, and WinZapp claims update_coord's update slot, which
   keeps any account from starting until the update is over (main.py exits a
   new account process while is_update_in_progress()). Only then does Install
   reach Sparkle: for a release not downloaded yet, it downloads and prepares
   its installer; for one downloaded in the background (2), it installs and
   relaunches at once (SPUUIBasedUpdateDriver.m:273-274).
4. At "Ready to Install", after a download the user started
   (SPUUIBasedUpdateDriver.m:416-425): the official repository is asked again
   and the item checked again; only a fresh yes answers Install, anything
   else answers Skip, which there cancels the prepared installer
   (SPUCoreBasedUpdateDriver.m:313-314 -> SPUInstallerDriver.m:563-572 ->
   AppInstaller.m:681-684). Quitting with that window unanswered installs on
   quit, as in 2 (an installer past its first stage installs whenever the
   app ends, AppInstaller.m:731-744): the other accounts are already closed
   and the update slot stays held until this process is gone.

When the update does not install after the other accounts were closed for it
(the download failed or was cancelled, Sparkle aborted, the last check
refused), the slot is given back, those accounts are opened again in the
background, and WinZapp says so.

The release notes of Sparkle's window are WinZapp's own when it can make
them (sparkle_notes.py): what changed between the running tag and the offered
one, fetched when the window is about to be shown and handed to Sparkle
through standardUserDriverWillShowReleaseNotesText:forUpdate:...
(SPUStandardUserDriverDelegate.h:192-205, called for plain-text notes,
SUTextViewReleaseNotesView.m:337-338). The appcast's notes stay when not.

All Sparkle calls happen on the main thread, which is wx's: Sparkle calls the
delegate and the user driver there, and the threads come back through
wx.CallAfter. No Python exception crosses into Objective-C: every method
Sparkle calls refuses (and logs) instead.
