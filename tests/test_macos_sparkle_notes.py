"""The release notes Sparkle's window shows on the Mac
(macos/winzapp_mac/sparkle_notes.py).

The appcast's notes for an alpha were the whole "V2.1.0.0" section, the same
paragraphs every alpha, so testers could not tell what one changed: the
Windows updater's problem of #488. The window now says what changed between
the tag the app runs and the tag offered, from the official repository: the
changelog compared in words, and for an alpha the pull requests of every
alpha in between. Pure: the download and the shipped changelog are fakes.
