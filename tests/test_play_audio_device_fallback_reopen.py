"""ConversationsPanel._play_audio()'s retry after an output-device fallback
called `_open_stream()`, a local closure that 83724638 (2026-09-03) turned
into the method `_open_audio_stream_from_temp_file()`. Two of its three
callers were updated; the one inside the device-fallback retry was not.

So when play() failed on a device BASS no longer had (a USB/Bluetooth
headset unplugged, the default device changed, Settings switching the
output), SoundSystem.handle_playback_failure() re-initialised BASS on the
default device and returned True — and the retry then raised NameError,
which its own `except` swallowed as "Retry after device fallback also
failed" before calling _stop_audio(). The message simply did not play, with
nothing said; only a second attempt worked. Shipped in 1.1.0.0 and 1.1.1.0.

pyflakes reports the undefined name; no test reached this branch.

ConversationsPanel is a wx.Panel, so _play_audio() is bound onto a plain
stub, the same way tests/test_toggle_playback_device_switch_recovery.py
covers the neighbouring _toggle_playback() recovery.
