"""The part of the Transcription tab that points WinZapp at models the user
already has in other folders, split out of transcription_tab.py.

A user who already transcribes with a model from another program — in the
Hugging Face cache, or wherever their script put it — does not have to
download it again: they add the folder, WinZapp checks it (the digest for one
of its catalogue models, a trial load for any other), and it appears in the
model picker. The decisions are in `core/transcription/external_models.py`
(what a folder is, what is stored) and `external_view.py` (what the tab says);
this module is the wx half and `ExternalModelsMixin` is mixed into
`SettingsDialog` beside `TranscriptionTabMixin`, whose own state (job flag,
announcement field, model picker) it shares.

What matters to the person using it:

* **Nothing here copies, moves or deletes a file of theirs.** "Forget" removes
  the reference and says so; the folder is never touched.
* **The slow parts never run on the wx thread.** Hashing 3 GB, loading a model
  and even *looking* at a folder on a drive that may be unplugged happen on
  worker threads, behind the same progress dialog and Cancel the model
  download has, and every result is spoken through `speak_output`.
* **References are written when they are checked, not on OK.** They are
  install-wide and describe the machine (the model files themselves do not
  wait for OK either); only *which model to use* is a setting of the dialog,
  and choosing one marks the dialog dirty like any other control does.
* **A whisper.cpp model is a file, not a folder** (external_ggml). "Add..."
  and "Find..." look for the kind the backend picker is on — a GGML file for
  whisper.cpp, a folder otherwise — and every sentence about a file says
  "file" (external_view.for_reference()). Both kinds share the one list.
