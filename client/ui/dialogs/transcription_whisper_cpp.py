"""The whisper.cpp part of the Transcription tab, split out of transcription_tab.py.

Two things the second backend (part 9b) adds to the tab, and only those:

* **The backend picker decides what the model picker lists.** Each backend
  loads its own files — faster-whisper a CTranslate2 folder, whisper.cpp one
  GGML file per quantization — so the model list is the catalogue of the
  backend selected *now* (`preferences.catalogue_models()`), redrawn as the
  backend changes. "Automatic" lists faster-whisper's, which is what it
  resolves to.
* **The whisper.cpp program.** whisper-cli is a download of its own: a build
  for the processor, and one for NVIDIA cards where the card can run it
  (`whisper_cpp_builds.builds_offered()` for its compute capability). It goes
  into a WinZapp-owned install-wide folder that the models-folder setting
  never moves (`whisper_cpp_runtime.default_runtime_dir()`). A read-only
  combobox lists the builds — the processor one always, and first — each item
  one sentence with its state and size, and four buttons under it act on the
  selected one, in a named group like the model and CUDA rows. They are
  management actions: asked about the same way, run behind the same progress
  dialog and said through the same funnel as the model downloads.

`WhisperCppMixin` is mixed into `SettingsDialog` beside `TranscriptionTabMixin`,
whose state it shares (job flag, action-button registry, probe, announcement
field). Nothing here is measured on opening the dialog beyond what the CUDA
line already reads: a manifest and the sizes of the files it lists.
