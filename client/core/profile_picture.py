"""Fetch a chat's or group's profile picture through WPPConnect.

`GET /api/<session>/profile-pic/<id>` answers with WA-JS's profile-picture
record (`{eurl, img, imgFull, id, tag, raw}`), or with nothing when the
picture is absent or hidden from this account by the contact's privacy
settings. The URLs inside point at WhatsApp's CDN and are signed, so they are
downloaded right away rather than stored. A group is asked with
`isGroup=true`, which makes the route suffix the id `@g.us`; anything else
keeps its `@lid` or becomes `@c.us` on the server side.

Nothing here touches wx: the dialog calls `fetch_profile_picture()` on a
background thread and only shows the result.
